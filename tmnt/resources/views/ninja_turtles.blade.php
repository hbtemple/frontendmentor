            <p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) are a fictional team of four teenage anthropomorphic turtles, who were trained by their anthropomorphic rat sensei in the art of ninjitsu. From their home in the sewers of New York City, they battle petty criminals, evil overlords, mutated creatures, and alien invaders while attempting to remain hidden from society. They were named after Italian Renaissance artists, and here's a brief overview of their origin and enemies from the original 80s cartoon.</p>

They came into contact with a mysterious radioactive ooze that transformed them into sentient creatures. Splinter, a rat once owned by a ninja named Hamato Yoshi, was also mutated by the ooze and became their caretaker and martial arts instructor, naming them after Renaissance artists and teaching them the ways of ninjitsu.</p>
